# veecle-osal-api

Veecle OS operating system abstraction layer API.

## Overview

This crate defines the operating system abstraction layer (OSAL) API for Veecle OS.
It provides trait definitions and interfaces for platform-agnostic abstractions over networking, time and logging.

**Note**: Most users should depend on the [`veecle-os`](https://crates.io/crates/veecle-os) crate instead of using this crate directly.
The `veecle-os` crate re-exports this functionality and provides a more complete API for building Veecle OS applications.

For examples and more detailed usage information, please refer to the [repository](https://github.com/veecle/veecle-os).
