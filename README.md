# Veecle OS

Veecle OS is a programming framework that enables developers to write software for low-power embedded devices and high-powered systems alike.
Veecle OS uses features from the Rust programming language to help software developers avoid common complexities.

Refer to the [user manual](https://veecle.github.io/veecle-os/user-manual/) to learn about Veecle OS usage.

Refer to [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build instructions and other development material.
After completing the setup instructions, go to [the examples](veecle-os-examples/) to run some Veecle OS example programs.
