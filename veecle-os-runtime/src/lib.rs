//! The Veecle OS runtime.
//!
//! This crate contains the main building blocks for any Veecle OS application.  Veecle OS applications are composed of [`Actor`]s,
//! that use the [`Reader`] and [`Writer`] types to communicate with each other within the runtime.
//!
//! This crate is meant to be used with asynchronous programming, which means that actors are expected to be async
//! functions. For example, it will be ensured that an actor does not update a value till all its readers had the
//! chance to read its latest state.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The following Veecle OS application consists of two actors, `PingActor` and `PongActor`, that communicate with each
//! other.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::convert::Infallible;
//! use std::fmt::Debug;
//!
//! use veecle_os_runtime::{Reader, Storable, Writer};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Default, Storable)]
//! pub struct Ping {
//!     value: u32,
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Default, Storable)]
//! pub struct Pong {
//!     value: u32,
//! }
//!
//! #[veecle_os_runtime::actor]
//! async fn ping_actor(mut ping: Writer<'_, Ping>, pong: Reader<'_, Pong>) -> Infallible {
//!     let mut value = 0;
//!     ping.write(Ping { value }).await;
//!
//!     let mut pong = pong.wait_init().await;
//!     loop {
//!         ping.write(Ping { value }).await;
//!         value += 1;
//!
//!         pong.wait_for_update().await.read(|pong| {
//!             println!("Pong: {}", pong.value);
//!         });
//! #       // Exit the application to allow doc-tests to complete.
//! #       std::process::exit(0);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[veecle_os_runtime::actor]
//! async fn pong_actor(mut pong: Writer<'_, Pong>, ping: Reader<'_, Ping>) -> Infallible {
//!     let mut ping = ping.wait_init().await;
//!     loop {
//!         let ping = ping.wait_for_update().await.read_cloned();
//!         println!("Ping: {}", ping.value);
//!
//!         let data = Pong { value: ping.value };
//!         pong.write(data).await;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! futures::executor::block_on(
//!     veecle_os_runtime::execute! {
//!         store: [Ping, Pong],
//!         actors: [
//!             PingActor,
//!             PongActor,
//!         ]
//!     }
//! )
//! ```
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! The expected output for this example would be a sequence of ping/pong messages like the following:
//!
//! ```shell
//! Ping: 1
//! Pong: 1
//! Ping: 2
//! Pong: 2
//! Ping: 3
//! Pong: 3
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! ## Execution
//!
//! See how the `PongActor` waits for `Ping` to be written by the `PingActor`.
//! If that were not the behavior, we would see `Ping: 0` as the very first output, since `Ping` defaults to zero.
//! The same would happen with the `PingActor`: if it were not waiting for `Pong` updates, its immediate action after
//! writing `Ping` would be to display `Pong: 0`. Waiting for updates ensures us that only written values are read.
//!
//! On the other hand, writing always yields for other woken futures to be executed before performing the write
//! operation. The only exception is the very first write, since there is no latest value for readers to read.
