# veecle-os-data-support-can

Support for working with CAN messages within Veecle OS.

## Overview

This crate provides the core types and functionality for working with CAN (Controller Area Network) messages in Veecle OS applications.
It includes support for CAN frame handling, message IDs, and integration with the Veecle OS runtime.

**Note**: Most users should depend on the [`veecle-os`](https://crates.io/crates/veecle-os) crate instead of using this crate directly.
The `veecle-os` crate re-exports this functionality and provides a more complete API for building Veecle OS applications.

For examples and more detailed usage information, please refer to the [repository](https://github.com/veecle/veecle-os).
