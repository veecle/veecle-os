# veecle-os-data-support-someip

This is a reference implementation to prototype compatibility between the `veecle-os` framework and [vSomeIP](https://github.com/COVESA/vsomeip).

**Note**: Most users should depend on the [`veecle-os`](https://crates.io/crates/veecle-os) crate instead of using this crate directly.
The `veecle-os` crate re-exports this functionality and provides a more complete API for building Veecle OS applications.
